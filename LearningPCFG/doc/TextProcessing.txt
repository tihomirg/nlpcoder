Transform a discourse to a list of declaration's groups.
1) Use NL parser to process a sentence.
2) Extract a verb.
3) For each verb find a group of nouns, that can influence name, arguments and retur type.
4) Form a group that contains verb and those auxiliary words.

Later we use those groups to select sequences and declarations.

Anaphora resolution:
1) Do some simple processing. Pronouns, articles, matching words, synonyms.

Plural resolution:
1) If a word is in a plural, that is a good indicator that we need a loop.

Manually connect some of the constructs with a set of words.
Key words should be connected to a specific words (e.g. "for", "while", should be connected with word "loop").
