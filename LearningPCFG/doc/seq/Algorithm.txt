Synthesis Algorithm:
1) Use words to select the best sequences.
2) Once we select one sequence, we start building a partial program.
3) The partial program may have holes.
4) For a partial program we keep the set of words it covers form the initial set of words.
5) The holes and the missing words are a good sign that we need more sequences.
6) A new sequence is chose based on the following constraints:
 - the type
 - the words
 - reads/writes including their positions
 - conditions (i.e. patterns)
 - frequency (language model)
7) For each criteria we build a scorer.
8) We choose the sequence with the best score 
10) The process continues until we fill in all holes
11) There is a high possibility that we will need to polish the code in the end:
  - fill in the missing holes with the in-synth like algorithm
  - fill in the literals

For each sequence we collect the words of:
  - the declaration
  - type 
  - characteristic for the location we picked the sequence from: variable name, surrounding method name, potentially some words from java doc comments.
