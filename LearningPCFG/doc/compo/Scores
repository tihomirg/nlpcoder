1. Declaration Score

Declaration selection:
  - declaration best fit score
  - declaration frequency

Each input word has importance, a value form interval (0,1]. It reflects the word importance for a given declaration. 
For instance, words that appear in the declaration name have higher weight that those 
that appear as parameter and return types.

Each declaration slot has importance, a value form interval (0,1]. We denote it with: \imp_{slot_i}.

score_{decl} = score_{best-fit} */+ score_{frequency}
score_{fit} = \log{\imp_{slot_1} * hit_1 + \imp_{slot_n} * hit_2 + ... \imp_{slot_n} * hit_n},             \imp_{slot_1} +....+ \imp_{slot_n} = 1   hit_i \leq 1


1.1. 
Best fit maximizes score_{best-fit}.
hit_i is the hit score of the i-th declaration word. The following contributes to hit_i:
- Group hit. If the words from the same group hit then this hit is 1 otherwise it is 0.5
- Word importance. For leading words it is 1, for others, related and supplementary (secondary) words it is less than 1.

hit_i = hit_{group} * imp_{word}

1.2.
score_{frequency} = \log{p_{decl}}
p_{decl} is a declaration probability, a declaration invocation frequency.

2. Partial Expression Score

score_{expr} = \sum score_{lm} + \sum score_{decl} + \sum connections - \sum pexpr_{repetitions} - \sum literal_{repetitions}
score_{lm} = log{p_{comp}}
