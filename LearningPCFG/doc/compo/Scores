1) Declaration Scoring Model

Declaration selection:
  - declaration best fit score
  - declaration frequency
  
Declaration words: w1 w2 w3 .... wn
Each word has (0,1] weight. It reflects the word importance for a given declaration. 
For instance, words that appear in the declaration name have higher weight that those 
that appear as parameter and return types.

Main model:

score_{decl} = \log{\lambda_1 * hit_1 + \lambda_2 * hit_2 + ... \lambda_n * hit_n} + \log{p_{decl}},             \lambda_1 +....+ \lambda_n = 1   hit_i \leq 1

Best fit maximizes this function.

hit_i is the hit score of the i-th declaration word. The following contributes to hit_i:
- Group hit. If the words from the same group hit than this hit is 1 otherwise it is 0.5
- Related words. If a related word hits, than hit is 

hit_i = hit_{group} * hit_{related}

Lambda calculation:
\lambda_i = w_i / \sum w_j


p_{decl} is a declaration probability, a declaration invocation frequency.

2) Partial Examples Scoring Model

score_{expr} = \sum score_{lm} + \sum score_{decl} + \sum connections - \sum pexpr_{repetitions} - \sum literal_{repetitions}

score_{lm} = log{p_{comp}}
