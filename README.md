# AnyCode

AnyCode is a new code assistance tool for integrated
development environments. Our system accepts free-form queries
allowing a mixture of English and Java as an input, and produces
Java code fragments that take the query into account and
respect syntax, types, and scoping rules of Java as well as
statistical usage patterns. The returned results need not have
the structure of any previously seen code fragment. As part
of our system we have constructed a probabilistic context free
grammar for Java constructs and library invocations, as well as
an algorithm that uses a customized natural language processing
tool chain to extract information from free-form text queries.

Our publication is available [here](http://lara.epfl.ch/~kuncak/papers/GveroKuncak15SynthesizingJavaExpressionsFreeFormQueries.pdf)
and our demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93vZAmLyOQY).
