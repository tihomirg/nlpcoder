Questions:

1. Are the sequences good at all?

Inspection:
1. What are observations?
2. Do they repeat?
3. Is there a sequence that can be combined with two different sequences?

Algorithm and implementation:
1. How to slice them?
2. How to combine them?
3. Should we include more techniques?
4. How to connect them with NL input?
