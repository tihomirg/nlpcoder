1) Unique declarations
2) Keep receiver tokens separated.
3) Clean selection table after you print/copy top statistics.
4) Think about WordNet, and what related words indeed to use. For some tokens, that are literals or locals we do not need related words.
5) What about lemmatization of "println"

Done:

1) Do word lemmatization. //Still see if we need WordNet lemmatizer/steammer.
