1) Clean selection table after you print/copy top statistics.
2) Think about WordNet, and what related words indeed to use. For some tokens, that are literals or locals we do not need related words.
3) Manually: What about lemmatization of "println" --> "print new line" //we should get this from the JavaDoc
4) Include JavaDoc.
5) Declaration frequencies
6) Connect and test.
7) Build word selection groups.
8) Implement missing methods in selection.

Done:

1) Do word lemmatization. //Still see if we need WordNet lemmatizer/steammer.
1) Unique declarations
2) Keep receiver tokens separated.
