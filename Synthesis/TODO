2) In statistics we use all methods/fields, so we should use the same in NLP part, i.e., we should use unique methods for each type. 

3) Merge algorithm
4) Local analysis
5) Literals
6) Type handler

7) Find char representation

8) NLP input and selection algorithm

9) To speed up parallel execution, duplicate some parts of the memory, or build a map that you can easily recreate afterwards.
 Also we would need to duplicate handlers. Have a pool of (5-6) handlers. And Scorer should be duplicated.
